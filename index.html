                    <p>
                        My name is Emily McGovern. I am currently living in Vicenza Italy, but I am from
                        the United States. I am always on the move, so I don't really have a place called home.
                        However, I love to call my family home. I love playing the violin and piano, video games,
                        videography,
                        traveling, and hanging around with my family. Some of my top favorite countries I have
                        visited are Greece, England, France, Slovenia, and Poland. Some of my goal countries to visited
                        are Norway, Iceland, and Spain.

                <div class="fav-countries">
                    <h4>France</h4>
                    <p>
                        France is a beautiful country. Even though Paris is insipiring and breath taking, the country
                        side
                        of France is what is most special about this country. In the country side you are able to see
                        beautiful
                        castles and quaint little villages that have a special place in my heart. One city that is a
                        must see
                        is Colmar. It feels like you are stepping into the fairytale story of Beauty and the Beast.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Slovenia</h4>
                    <p>
                        Slovenia is a country full of greenery and magnificent scenery. Even though I have only visited
                        Slovenia
                        a couple of times, it has a special place in my heart. This country has wonderful hikes and
                        breath taking via
                        ferratas.
                        My favorite place to visit is Lake Bled. The city of Bled does not only have a castle over
                        looking a lake, but
                        it has an island in the middle of the lake that contains a beautiful church and a delicious
                        gelato shop.
                    </p>
                    <h4>England</h4>
                    <p>
                        England is always full of wonderful and enjoyment. If you don't fall in love with the accents,
                        you sure will fall
                        in love with what the country has to offer. To it's quaint country side to the big city of
                        London, this country has
                        it all. I especially love learning and seeing the history. The historical sights are fascinating
                        to see and learn about
                        throughout London.
